# Introduction

This notebook presents an analysis of a dataset focusing on obesity levels in individuals. The primary objective of this analysis is to uncover insights into factors contributing to obesity and to construct a predictive model capable of classifying obesity levels based on the provided features.

# Overview

The dataset comprises several features providing insights into individuals' lifestyles, and physical conditions:

- Gender: Identifies the gender of the individual (e.g., Male or Female).
- Age: Indicates the age of the individual.
- Height: Specifies the height of the individual.
- Weight: Indicates the weight of the individual.
- Family History with Overweight: Indicates whether the individual has a family history of overweight.
- FAVC (Frequent Consumption of High Caloric Food): Indicates frequent consumption of high-caloric food.
- FCVC (Frequency of Consumption of Vegetables): Represents the frequency of vegetable consumption.
- NCP (Number of Main Meals): Specifies the number of main meals consumed by the individual.
- CAEC (Consumption of Food Between Meals): Indicates the frequency of food consumption between meals.
- CH2O (Consumption of Water Daily): Represents the daily consumption of water.
- SCC (Calories Consumption Monitoring): Indicates whether the individual monitors calorie consumption.
- FAF (Physical Activity Frequency): Represents the frequency of physical activity.
- TUE (Time Using Technology Devices): Specifies the time spent using technology devices.
- CALC (Consumption of Alcohol): Indicates alcohol consumption by the individual.
- MTRANS (Transportation Used): Specifies the mode of transportation used by the individual.
- NObeyesdad (Obesity Level): Represents the individual's obesity level (Target).

The dataset contains a total 18 features. Each record corresponds to an individual, with the features providing various insights into their lifestyle and physical condition. The target variable, "NObeyesdad," categorizes individuals into different obesity levels based on predefined categories.
